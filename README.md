# 18_355 Final Project: Simple Adjoint Implementation

Training loss shown below; example data is in `data/VB`.
Adjoint implementation is in `src/ml/models/adjoint`.
Simple model is in `src/ml/models/sanity_check.py`

The rest of the code is in preparation for 2D and extensions as in the presentation.

Technically it should run via `make run`.
If not, the main training script is `src/ml/runners/train.py` and should be directly called.
